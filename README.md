# passion-project-final

DESCRIPTION:
This project allows users to add/edit/read/delete new places to go on weekends. The application allows users to read each place to go belongs to which category and when is the best season to go to that location.


TABLES: 
The system consists of three tables, namely places, category, and best season to go. Each place has a single category and best season to go, while a category or season can be associated with many places.

API:
To demonstrate the functionality of the API, the Places List displays a unique ID, the name of the place, and options for editing and deleting the place. By selecting a specific place, the user can access its details, including its category and best season to visit. On this details page, the user can modify the place's details or delete it.

Additionally, the system allows for the creation of new places by setting the place ID, category, and best season to go on the places list page.

The Category List displays all available categories, and by clicking on each category, the user is redirected to the details page that shows all places associated with the selected category.

Similarly, the Best Season to Go table shows the list of seasons, and by clicking on each season, the user is redirected to the details page that shows all the places best suited for visiting during that season.
